  <p>Originating from China and the Near East, embroidery can be traced as far back as 30,000 BCE. In Sweden around the 9th and 10th century, embroidery on garments and ornaments was a sign of rich or high status. Often times you could find patterns stitched onto tablecloths, tapestries, and the clothes they would wear. In Medieval Islamic societies, embroidery on ones person would indicate high social status. This could include their handkerchief, clothing, flag, and bags they had.<br>During the 18th century, Embroidery became more specific to gender standers in England. A women’s transition into adulthood was marked by her ability in embroidery. If she could successfully preform the art, it would earn her a high social status, and informed those around her that she had grown. In France during the mid 1800’s, the earliest embroidery machine was made utilizing looms from machines and hand embroidery. When the 1900’s hit, embroidery become more popular and common with the new inclusion of mail order catalogues.<br>Modern embroidery is a mixture of traditional means and new technology.  Companies use embroidery machines with digitalized photos to create a pattern with. Others use hand loop embroidery techniques, incorporating modern styling techniques and materials.</p>

  <h2>Materials</h2>

   <p>While there is a great number of ways to preform embroidery, one of the more popular styles in hand loop embroidery. Its the one you see with the wooden hoop containing a circle of fabric. You can find these hoops at any local craft stores, many loops come in different sizes and materials such as wooden or plastic. You don’t need to worry on the type of hoop you get, as both function the same. The next step is finding the yarn. You should always plan out your design before purchasing the yarn. Figure out what kind of colors you want, and what would look best with each other. Some artist prefer to draw their design out before purchasing materials in order to get the best picture of what they want.</p>
  
   <p>Needles and pins are easy to come by at most convince stores. They should be basic sewing needles, never big enough to cause too big a whole within the canvas. Its always a good idea to have a fabric pen or pencil on hand to draw out the design before beginning. Other handy things you could bring would be scissors for cutting loose threads and fabric makers for extra coloring or detail. Optional materials you could purchase are beads and sequins, as many modern designs incorporate them into the yarn and fabric.<br>For the best materials and hand loops, click the link below to browse our catalogue of embroidery materials and fabrics.</p>

  <h2>Fabric Laying</h2>
  
  <img src="https://assets.codepen.io/4988478/fabric-laying1.png" alt="fabric laying">
  
  <p>Once you have your hoop ready, simply unscrew the handle at the top and lay your fabric inside. You can either choose one corner of the canvas or the middle depending on the design and how much space you want left over. This makes the space easy to work on and steady for your hand. Some even prefer to leave the design inside the hoop, using it as a frame of sorts. Once the fabric is set and the handle is screwed shut, you can use a pen or pencil to draw on the design you want, to create a guide for your needle. Try using a bank canvas to practice different types of threading before beginning, as once you make a mistake within embroidery, it can sometimes be difficult to correct it.</p>

  <h2>Needle and Thread</h2>
  
  <div class="row">
  <div class="columns_2 needles">
    <p>Once your design and pattern is all drawn out, you can begin filling it in using a needle and thread. Within the fabric there are a multitude of small holes to fit your needle and thread through. Simply thread through one and back out the other in a forward motion to create lines on your canvas. Be careful no to make them too big or the yarn will become too loose and sag or even fall off. Making them too short can have similar issues, unless it’s for detail purposes.</p>
 </div>
  
  <div class="columns_2">
    <p>Remember to complete the outline of the shape before filling it in. When filling in the shape, remember to have every line face in the same direction, this makes the pattens look clean and refined, and also is the easiest to create. Avoid going over different yarns with each other, as it could create problems on the canvas.</p>

  <h2>Incorporation</h2>
  <p>Many types of embroidery over the years have included different materials to incorporate besides yarn. In more recent times, many people have began using new types of beads and sequins. This provides a creative new look the the design while also displaying texture you otherwise couldn’t achieve with basic thread.<br>Be careful not to overdo anything however, as it could take too much away from the design and end up looking like a mess. There should be a good balance of elements on your canvas when the design is finished with, with each element in unity with each other. You also need to take into consideration the colors of each bead and how they match with the rest of the yarn.</p>
